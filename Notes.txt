Difficulty on this projects?

#1

I needed a way to efficiently render all the tickets without needing to fetch data everytime I create or update a ticket.
What I did was to incorporate redux toolkit to store all the fetched data on local storage and update the data in the redux storage accordingly whenever a 
ticket was modified. Additionally, I added redux persist on top of it so that the data is presisted whenever the page reloads.

#2

In the project there were some common data that was needed by components across the application and I wanted avoid passing down those data down as props into 
child components. What I did was to incorporate redux toolkit to store all common data on local storage, so that components can directly access this global state
without needing to access passdown props. 

So issue was solved, however the data was persisting whenever the page reloaded. What I did was to add redux-persist on top of it to persist all my data. As a result
I was able to access all my global state, as well as persist them
